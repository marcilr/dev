Sometimes when working with an image you want to make a certain 
color transparent. When working with a gif file this would make a 
round circle look round on any color background. This is actually 
very simple once you do it once. Finding the information for this 
took me a while so I thought I would pass it on to anyone that was 
interested.

1. Open your image in the gimp.

2. Right click the image and go to LAYERS then ADD ALPHA CHANNEL. 
You won't notice anything happening, but don't be concerned. It 
basically adds a transparent layer at the bottom of your image so 
when we erase the colors.....it's shows the transparent layer. 
Which of course would show whatever was under it on the screen.

3. Right click on the image again and go to SELECT and then down 
to BY COLOR. A window that is all black opens up. Don't change any 
of the settings....just use the defaults for now.

4. Now click on the color in the image you want to be transparent. 
These colors will now show up outlined.

5. Right click on the image again and go to EDIT and then down to 
CLEAR. This should now erase the outlined color you just picked 
from the image and the "transparent gimp checkerbox" should show 
through. This is the Gimps way of showing you that section is now 
transparent.

6. Right click on the image and choose SAVE AS and make sure to 
save as a GIF file if you want the transparency to work on the web.
