+++ Wed Apr 16 10:01:21 AKDT 2014 - Google Map api and access?

+++ Tue Feb  7 07:50:57 AKST 2012 - Need to break up 00DEV into separate repos.

+++ Thu Apr 26 08:58:05 AKDT 2007 - The cvs-branches LaTeX document, written
by James A. Crippen, in the Spectrum Wireless days doesn't build under debian
etch. migrated from docs_new repo.  Perhaps needs a fix?


Development
===========
+++ Thu Apr 26 08:58:05 AKDT 2007 - Write document regard xlst usage.

+++ Thu Apr 26 08:58:05 AKDT 2007 - Need better understanding of using
TestNG, the replacement for JUnit, for better unit tests.

+++ Thu Apr 26 08:58:05 AKDT 2007 - I like to keep development documentation
in plain text files.  Often I put an index to sections towards the header of
the file.   One question is how to automated maintain the index to specific 
lines?  The  location of lines changes when content is added of 
removed.  A bit tricky.


Debian
======
+++ Thu Apr 26 08:58:05 AKDT 2007 - Encrypted filesystem based on login?
Actually want to save the encrypted files to subverison or cvs and have them
decrypted automatedly when accessed locally.

Filesystem Encryption Tools for Linux
-------------------------------------
Crypto filesystems keep your data safe - even if someone 
steals your computer.Linux offers a number of encrypted filesystem 
options - each with a different approach to the encryption problem.
Encrypted filesystems may be overkill for family photos or your 
resume, but they make sense for network-accessible servers that 
hold sensitive business documents, databases that hold sensitive 
business documents, databases that contain credit-card information, 
offline backups, and laptops.

infrastructure.


Javascript
==========
+++ Thu Apr 26 08:58:05 AKDT 2007 - Would be nice to make a javascript library
of funtions. Following a function from the AMI MOA Inspection Request project
that set a form select back to the previously selected option 
prior to form submission.

mainMorning.cfm:54
//
// setDisciplineSelect()
// Set the discipline form selected option.
// INPUT:  id           The id of the discipline select.
//         discipline   The discipline value to select.
//                      Values 1-7.
//
function setDisciplineSelect(id,discipline){
    //alert('setDisciplineSelect(' + id + ',' + discipline + ')');

    // Get select element.
    disciplineSelect = document.getElementById(id);
    //alert('disciplineSelect.length: ' + disciplineSelect.length);

    // Find displine select option selected previously.
    for (var i = 0; i < disciplineSelect.length; i++){
        value = disciplineSelect[i].value;
        if (value == discipline){
          
            // Select prior discipline option.
            disciplineSelect[i].selected = true;
            //alert('Selected discipline: ' + value);
            
            break;
        } // end if
    } // end for
} // end function

mainMorning.cfm:415

MS SQL Server Jim Weller mentioned "DTS". Accessed from Enterprise Manager.
Need to check out.

x Sep 16, 2010 - Class Dependency Analyzer dev/cda/ repo.
Thu Feb 26 10:52:41 AKST 2009 - Program to graph java dependencies in source
code hierarchy.

x Aug 25, 2010 - Move/merge language relevant directories to separate
directories under 00LANG.  This includes:
  bash   Migrated to 00LAN/bash
  css    Migrated to 00LANG/css 


Coldfusion
==========
x JUnit unit testing would be good.  i.e. test coldfusion component
functions and HttpUnit testing of cfm pages.  Perhaps use
JavaLoader.cfc to actually load the junit api itself?

"MXUnit is a unit testing framework for ColdFusion MX built upon the
popular JUnit test framework. It is designed to get you up and 
running quickly writing tests for your CFMX components."
see: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mxunit/

x Log4j logging from within cfscript?
This just works with:
  SESSION.bsdinspect.log.debug("Log output");

Assume session variable is set.
see: log4j.txt

x Got ultraedit-32 installed on workstation. Now need to fix it up.
With downloaded coldfusion61.txt syntax hightlighting file it loves
to auto-capitralize HTML and coldfusion markup. Need to determine
how to disable this.

Form AMI MOA Inspection Request. 
Logging from within cfscript.

inspectors.cfc:536
<cfscript>
    if (inspectorDay neq "NULL"){
        SESSION.bsdinspect.log.debug('inspectorDay neq "NULL"');
        if (inspectorDay eq "0"){
            inspectorDay="NULL";
        }
    }
</cfscript>

x coldfusion <cflog conditional="???" operators accepted?
Is equal just "="?

Done. See coldfusion/cfloop.txt.
