# swish-e/   Swish-e is a fast, flexible, and free open source system for
#            indexing collections of Web pages or other files.  Swish-e is
#            ideally suited for collections of a million documents or smaller.
#            Using the GNOME libxml2 parser and a collection of filters,
#            Swish-e can index plain text, e-mail, PDF, HTML, XML, Microsoft
#            Word/PowerPoint/Excel and just about any file that can be 
#            converted to XML or HTML text.  Swish-e is also often used to
#            supplement databases like the MySQL DBMS for very fast full-text
#            searching.
