Unix time, or POSIX time, is a system for describing instances in time, defined as the number of
seconds that have elapsed since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), 1 January 1970, [note 1]
not counting leap seconds.[note 2]  It is used widely in Unix-like and many other operating systems
and file formats.  It is neither a linear representation of time nor a true representation of
UTC.[note 3]

TODO: Add formula for calculation of unix time since midnight Coordinated Universal Time
      January 1, 1970.

=============================
While working on the TiVo Cookie Datestamp issue where TiVo, both Topaz and Beryl, were sending
and expired unixtime datestamp (Sat, 16 Feb 2013 00:00:00) in a cookie.

This broke my linux-based kmttg download client [1]:

# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
# http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html
# This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.

10.1.0.167      FALSE   /       FALSE   1360972800      sid     825BE997C6F6D519


The TiVo does not reset the time field hence setting a new unixtime far in the
future, like 4102358400 = Thu, 31 Dec 2099 00:00:00 works fine.

i.e. The TiVo cookie expires on Sat, 16 Feb 2013 00:00:00 GMT breaks TivoToGo (TTG) downloads
     of files to clients like kmttg [1] or TiVo [2].

=============================
Whilst working at UAA ITS I ran into Elluminate Inc. software which appears to store
startDate & endDate values in ms sql 2005 tables (elive.Meetings) in unixtime (posix) values.  

Working on easy encoding/decoding.

Date/Time/Unixtime
1. How to convert date to unixtime in perl (or vice versa)
# time return number of seconds since 0 in your computer (1 jan 1970) on unix
# localtime converts unixtime to normal dates
To convert a specific date to its corresponding unixtime, you use Time::Local, the function 
looks like this:

      $time = timelocal($sec,$min,$hours,$mday,$mon,$year); 

so to convert 3rd of Sept 2000 to unixtime, (note that jan=0,feb=1,...):

  use Time::Local;
  $time = timelocal(0,0,0,'3','08','2000');

Leap Seconds
============
In 1972 the leap-second system was introduced so that the broadcast UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)
seconds could be made exactly equal to the standard SI [6] second, while still maintaining the UTC
time of day and changes of UTC date synchronized with those of UT1 (the solar time standard that
superseded GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)).[7]  By then the UTC clock was already 10 seconds behind TAI
(International Atomic Time), which had been synchronized with UT1 in 1958 but had been counting
true SI seconds since then.  After 1972, both clocks have been ticking in SI seconds, so the
difference between their readouts at any time is 10 seconds plus the total number of leap seconds
that have been applied to UTC (35 seconds in July 2012).

Notes
=====
[note 1] Unix times are defined, but negative, before 1 January 1970.

[note 2] Leap seconds are scheduled by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems
         Service [3] and are not predictable.

[note 3] Unix time cannot unambiguously represent UTC leap seconds
         (e.g. 31 December 1998 23:59:60), although otherwise the times it represents are UTC.

[note 4] A day could theoretically be 86399 seconds long though this option had never been used as
         of December 2010.

[note 5] As of 2012 all leap second events have involved insertion of an extra second.

[note 6] Leap seconds have been inserted on average once every year and a half.

[note 7] It is important to ensure that the right type of modulus is being calculated when dealing
         with times before the epoch, as different algorithms yield values with different values
         and signs, see Modulo operation [4] for details.

[note 8] Dennis Ritchie[5], when asked about this issue, said that he hadn't thought very deeply
         about it, but was of the opinion that the ability to represent all times within his
         lifetime would be nice.  (Ritchie's birth, in 1941, is around Unix time -893 400 000,
         so he did indeed achieve his goal).

Leap second
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC) in order to keep its time of day close to the mean solar time.  The most recent leap second
was inserted on June 30, 2012 at 23:59:60 UTC.
