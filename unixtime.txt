Whilst working at UAA ITS I ran into Elluminate Inc. software which
appears to store startDate & endDate values in ms sql 2005 tables 
(elive.Meetings) in unixtime (posix) values.  

Working on easy encoding/decoding.

Date/Time/Unixtime
1. How to convert date to unixtime in perl (or vice versa)
# time return number of seconds since 0 in your computer (1 jan 1970) on unix
# localtime converts unixtime to normal dates
To convert a specific date to its corresponding unixtime, you use Time::Local, the function 
looks like this:

      $time = timelocal($sec,$min,$hours,$mday,$mon,$year); 

so to convert 3rd of Sept 2000 to unixtime, (note that jan=0,feb=1,...):

  use Time::Local;
  $time = timelocal(0,0,0,'3','08','2000');
