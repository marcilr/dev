Version number is composed by three digits: major.minor.release


Major digit will change when major modifications are made.  Read it as a "new very important
  functions available" flag. When this digit change, all minor digit will be zeroed.

Minor digit will change when minor modifications or enhancements are made.  Maybe new useful
  functions are added but not so important on the usage of the application.  When this digit
  change, all minor digit will be zeroed.

Release digit will change when only bug fixes are applied.

So, if bug fixes are applied but also new features are added, the Major or Minor digits will
prevail on Release digit.
