For projects I'd like define and possible make templates
for the standard set of project documents.


Project Documents:
=================
* project proposal
* goals/objectives
* project plan
* project design
* estimated timeline
* progress reports
* completion report
* final report

Technical and supporting documentation (for projects creating
technical deliverables).
