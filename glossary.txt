cvcs - centralized version control system

dvcs - distributed version control system
  The three primary distributed version control systems are:
  o git       - http://git-scm.com/
  o mercurial - http://mercurial.selenic.com/
  o bazaar    - http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/

KPI - A performance indicator or key performance indicator (KPI) is a
  type of performance measurement.[1] KPIs evaluate the success of an
  organization or of a particular activity (such as projects, programs,
  products and other initiatives) in which it engages.

LOE - Level of effort. In project management, level of effort (LOE)
  is a support-type project activity that must be done to support other
  work activities or the entire project effort. It usually consists of
  short amounts of work that must be repeated periodically.

SDLC - The systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the
  application development life-cycle, is a term used in systems
  engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe
  a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information
  system.

vcs - Version Control System, Revision control, also known as version control
  and source control (and an aspect of software configuration management), is
  the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites,
  and other collections of information.

  Version control systems include perforce and subversion.

Glossary of Bazaar Version Control Terms - Sweet!
========================================
ancestor - A revision that came before another revision 
ancestor,common,minimal - (undone) Unknown term. Fill me in!
ancestor, intransitive - An ancestor revision that was a cherry-picked
   revision.
ancestor, nontransitive - See ancestor, intransitive
ancestral parent - A fully merged branch.
asynchronous - Operations not dependant upon ordering. 

branch - a line of development. Also known as "an ordered series of revisions".
branch, bound - a branch that sends revisions to another branch first.
branch, shared - A branch that supports commits from multiple developers.
branch, repository - (verify) A branch that depends upon a repository for RCS
  storage.
branch, standalone - A branch that is not part of a repository
branches, diverged - Two related branches that have had different commits
  since their last common revision are diverged. 

centralized development - multiple committers in one branch
centralized storage - saving multiple branches in one place.
checkout - a synonym for BoundBranch.
cherrypicking - Selecting specific revisions to apply to a working tree.
commit - Instructions that the RCS should checkpoint the tree. 

DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph. The graph of revisions where each revision is
  connected to its parent revisions.

delta - The change between two revisions.
deprecation phase - Period during which an interface declared obsolete is being 
  discouraged from use in the code by run time warnings. 

inventory weave - The inventory for a branch, stored in weave format. 

knit - The current storage format for Bazaar. 

lockstep - Two or more operations that should either succeed or fail as one
  pair.

lockstep development - Working on a shared branch, so that no one can commit
  unless they are up-to-date. 

merge - determining the outstanding revisions in one branch and applying them
  to another.

merge,crisscross - (undone) A failed type of merge caused by two branches
  merging each other at the same time. 

nested trees - One directory tree made up of one or more branches.
nit - mispelling of Knit.

nuclear launch codes - Strawman example of data that must be excised from a
  branch.

nuclear waste - Strawman example of unuseful bulk data that poisons a branch. 

repository - A library of revisions for branches.

repository, shared - A repository that is used by multiple branches, so that
  common history of those branches is only stored once, thus reducing the disk
  space needed to store multiple branches.

revert - returning a working tree to the most recent revision.

revision - A snapshot and associated data of a working tree that is created
  during commit.

revision, ancestor - See ancestor
revision, ghost - A revision that a branch knows about but does not have.

revision, dominant - (undone) A revision in a branch that was the result of a
  commit and not a merge.

revision, dominant, common - (undone) A revision that is common to two
  branches that was the result of a commit that happened prior to divergance.

revision, parent - The revision that comes immediately prior to this revision. 

smart server - a program that brokers operations for intelligent bzr specific
  interactions on behalf of a client.  Contrasts with dumb transports
  (e.g. http, sftp, the filesystem) currently supported by bzr.

smart server, dedicated -(undone) a smart server that is requires some sort of
  communication pipeline (accepts network connections, sockets and other
  posisbilities) and is intended to be run continiously.

smart server, spawned - (undone) a smart server that is run over a local or
  remote shell, via methods such as ssh.

storage layer - (undone) The logically discrete portion of bazaar-ng code that
  is responsible for pulling and storing bzr related information.

storage layer, ancestral The part of the storage layer that is concerned with
  retrieving and storing history.

storage layer, configuration - (undone)(under contention) The part of the
  storage layer that is concerned with the retrieval and storage of user and
  branch configuration data.

store - An object that associates a binary blob with a unique identifier.
store, text - See store

store, weave - (undone) A store that uses two identifiers instead of one: a
  file identifier, and a revision identifier. It stores the data in a set of
  weaves.  The file identifier is used to select the weave, while the revision
  identifier speficies the revision within the weave.

synchronous - a method for performing multiple operations one at a time.  This
  method is required for performing a series of actions that are each
  dependant upon the results of previous actions. 

tag - A descriptive word used as a nickname for a revision.
testament - A canonicalized, abbreviated revision description used for signing. 

weave - (undone) A format for recording the differences in files between
  revisions by recording which revisions in which a line in the weave is
  present.

weavedelta - An early term for knit. See knit
weavediff - (undone) An append-only format whose logical structure is a weave.
working tree - A version controlled directory with files you can hack on.
