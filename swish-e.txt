Swish-e
Simple Web Indexing System for Humans - Enhanced 

Swish-e is a fast, flexible, and free open source system for indexing collections of Web 
pages or other files. Swish-e is ideally suited for collections of a million documents or 
smaller. Using the GNOME libxml2 parser and a collection of filters, Swish-e can index 
plain text, e-mail, PDF, HTML, XML, Microsoft Word/PowerPoint/Excel and just about any file 
that can be converted to XML or HTML text. Swish-e is also often used to supplement 
databases like the MySQL DBMS for very fast full-text searching.

Build Index
===========
When indexing it may be advisable to index to a temporary file, and then after indexing has successfully 
completed rename the file to the final location. This is especially important when replacing an index that is 
currently in use.

swish-e -c swish.config -f index.tmp
[check return code from swish or look for err: output]
mv index.tmp index.swish-e

from: 


Search
======
Searching a Swish-e index involves passing command line arguments to it that specify the 
index file to use, and the query (or search words) to locate in the index. Swish-e returns a 
list of file names (or URLs) that contain the matched search words. 

  swish-e -w foo bar              # Search for files with foo and bar.
  swish-e -w bar foo
  swish-e -w foo AND bar

  swish-e -f ~/index.swish foo    # Specify index file.
