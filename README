Best ways to generate PDFs from various documet formats.


Microsoft Word
==============
Use AbiWord v2.4.6 print under debian etch.

$ dpkg -l | grep abiword
ii  abiword-common     2.4.6-1.1     WYSIWYG word processor based on GTK2
ii  abiword-gnome      2.4.6-1.1     WYSIWYG word processor based on GTK2/GNOME2


PDF to text
===========
2) Install poppler-utils or xpdf for full-text indexing of PDFs
If pdftotext is not installed on your system (i.e. `which pdftotext` returns nothing at the 
command line), install poppler-utils which bundles pdftotext (PDF to text converter), 
pdfinfo (PDF document information extractor), pdfimages (PDF image extractor), and pdffonts 
(PDF font analyzer). Note: xpdf bundles these utilities and more. However, poppler-utils is 
the preferred option since only the command-line converters are required. 
  sudo apt-get install poppler-utils


If poppler-utils is unavailable, install xpdf:
  sudo apt-get install xpdf
