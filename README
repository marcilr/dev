uncanny-gap.txt
  While watching Science of the Movies on the Discovery, on TiVo on Nov 24, 2009, saw a great
  segment on the "uncanny gap".  Basically CGI of human beings has improved on a study curve
  for a number of years.  However, an "uncanny gap" is reached where no amount of
  enhancements improve the portrayal of the person.  In fact minor "impovements" make the
  realism much worse.  The realism curve drops off sharply. Within the last year the gap
  was bridged.
