How to move a subversion repository
Blog : December 2006
Ben Finney 8:30 PM on 30 Dec 2006
Obligatory plug for distributed version control systems.  If you would move
your work into something like Bazaar or Darcs, you could work in a
central-repository mode as much as you like, with the added benefit that
branching and merging, and moving from place to place, would be trivially easy
when you wanted to do them.

mkinitramfs 0.9.9 - From surfing freshmeat.  
mkinitramfs is intended to create the ultimate initramfs image.  
It's designed to boot from any media (SATA, PATA, SCSI, USB,  
CD-ROM, etc.) without any changes being made to your disk. However,  
it is very simple (about 400 lines of code).
