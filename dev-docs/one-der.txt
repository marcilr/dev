Very cool article on building a one instruction computer.  Great CS info.


Books

Build Your Own Printed Circuit Board (Paperback)
by Al Willaims
"Printed circuit boards are at the heart of just about every electronic device
made today - PCs, cell phones, MP3 players, PDAs, telephones, stereos, TVs,
remote controls, cameras, your car, and even small appliances.  The reason
these items have come down in price over the years is because of printed
circuit boards. Whereas before you had to pay someone to physically connect
(and repair!) wires for each component (a time-consuming and thus expensive
prospect), now an error-proof, custom "PCB" is installed instead.  Hobbyists
and designers can now start their projects with a printed circuit board,
rather than using it as a last step (and contracting it out to someone else,
as was previously the norm).  It not only makes a more professional-looking
prototype, but also makes it easy to mass-produce.  And the techniques are the
same for the hobbyist working on a single project. This will be by far the
most modern book on the market, with the latest and greatest techniques for 
producing intricate PCB's at a fraction of the cost of sending them out."

The Circuit Designer's Companion, Second Edition
(EDN Series for Design Engineers) (Paperback)
Tim Williams' Circuit Designer's Companion provides a unique masterclass in
practical electronic design that draws on his considerable experience as a
consultant and design engineer.  As well as introducing key areas of design
with insider's knowledge, Tim focuses on the art of designing circuits so that
every production model will perform its specified function - and no other
unwanted function - reliably over its lifetime.

The combination of design alchemy and awareness of commercial and
manufacturing factors makes this an essential companion for the professional
electronics designer.  Topics covered include analog and digital circuits,
component types, power supplies and printed circuit board design.
$57.76 (amazon, Nov 19, 2009)


The Art of Electronics (Hardcover)
Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill
"Full of clever circuits and sharp insights, but with a surprising minimum of 
mathematics... The depth is genuine, as is the richness of examples, data and
apt tricks."
Scientific American
$75.07 (amazon, Nov 19, 2009)
