STUBS and Franki/Earlgrey Linux 0.6.7pre1/0.9.0pre2 (STUBS Configurations)
by William Towle - Mon, Feb 27th 2006 17:03 PDT 	

About: Franki and Earlgrey Linux are small but usable Linux distributions designed to 
demonstrate the full extent of STUBS, the Toolchain and Utility Build Suite. STUBS is a set 
of configuration files and scripts designed to build (and optionally employ) toolchains
from just a list of desired packages, and has scripts capable of downloading sources as 
necessary beforehand. It is designed to both bootstrap and work within the Franki Linux 
environment, requiring just kernel headers and working make/gcc/binutils to do so.

Changes: This is an interim Configurations release that updates a number of package versions 
and obsoleted URLs. Package updates include e3, Perl, rsyslog, rzip, and tftp-hpa; additions 
include cpuid, dmidecode, and muhttpd.
