Re:My 1.1 opinion (Score:5, Funny)
    * .0 is risky business.
    * .1 is slightly more stable.
    * .2 is pretty stable.
    * .3 is really stable.
    * .4 is rock solid.
    * .5 is without a doubt really stable.
    * .6 may contain new code for the next .0 release, so it's less stable.
    * .7 probably contains new code for the next .0 release.
    * .8 -- will it even start?
    * .9 ships in a makeshift box made out of duct tape and old newspapers.
