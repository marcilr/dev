Re: Commenting, was: Inline POD vs. EOF POD

  On several occasions a monk who we all think highly of, let me know that
  good code comments itself.  If you choose the names of variables and
  functions carefully, their function in the program becomes clear without
  separate comments.

Yeah, I've heard that before too.  K&P write that too. And it's certainly true
that well written code needs less comments.  It avoids micro comments, of the
style "add one to the number of elements".  However, in general well choosen
names of variables don't explain *why* certain actions are taken.  At best
they tell us what is going on.  And usually, they don't tell enough of the
global picture, an entire block or function.  Names alone don't tell us why
statements have to be done in a certain order - they don't show pre- or post
conditions.

I know only one program of substantial size that's commented only sparsely,
and that's perl.  But I've never heard that code is easy to grasp...
