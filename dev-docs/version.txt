Software packages typically have a version number associated
with them. Working for Alaska State DNR LRIS GIS the 
packages have a VERSION file in the base of every project with:


major=1
minor=1
patch=3

state=<p|a|b>              # If not specified assumed "f" for "final"
                           # or "rc" for release candidate is assumed.
                           #   p = pre-alpha
                           #   a = alpha
                           #   b = beta

prerelease=<0,1,2,3,...>   # Numeric code specifying prerelease number.
                           # Assume "0" if not specified.

This file is read by the ant build.xml with:
  <property file="VERSION"/>
  <property name="version" value="${major}.${minor}.${patch}"/>

This version property is then embedded in filenames and such.

Thinking of adding a stage indicator. This would be an alpha character 
appended to the end of the version string drawn from the set 
development/prealpha, alpha, beta and final/release. Appended next
would be a one-byte (i.e. having values in the range 0-255) pre-release 
version, which is only used at stages prior to final. These
chracters would include "a", "b", and "f". The "f" for final
would not be appended to the string.


Ant integration:
===============
Integrating the VERSION file with ant build.xml took a little 
thought. Dropped Ant-Contrib into lib directory in root of
project for use of "if" task to decide on use of "stage" if
present.

<!-- Pull in ant-contrib-1.03.jar resources -->
<taskdef resource="net/sf/antcontrib/antcontrib.properties">
  <classpath>
    <pathelement location="${basedir}/lib/ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar"/>
  </classpath>
</taskdef>


<target name="init">
 ...
    <property file="VERSION"/>

    <!-- Check for stage property -->
    <if>
      <isset property="stage"/>
      <then>
        <property name="version" value="${major}.${minor}.${patch}${stage}"/>
      </then>
      <else>
        <property name="version" value="${major}.${minor}.${patch}"/>
      </else>
    </if>

    <property name="package.jar.filename" 
              value="${ant.project.name}-${version}.jar" />
  ...
</init>
