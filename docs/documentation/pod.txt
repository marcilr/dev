Plain Old Documentation, abbreviated pod, is a simple markup language used to document the 
Perl programming language.

pod is designed to be a simple, clean language with just enough syntax to be useful. It 
purposefully does not include mechanisms for fonts, images, colors or tables; instead it 
attempts to be just large enough to be useful. Some of its goals are:

    * Easy to parse
    * Easy to convert to other languages, such as HTML or TeX
    * Easy to incorporate sample code
    * Easy to read without a pod formatter (i.e. in its source-code form)
    * Easy to write in--otherwise programmers won't write the documentation!
