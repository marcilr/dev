SDF (Simple Document Format)


Thu Sep 28 08:56:55 AKDT 2006
=============================
Queried Jason Guild about the easy document format he
mentioned a while back. Confirmed that it was SDF.


What is SDF?
===========
SDF (Simple Document Format) is a freely available document development
system which generates high quality outputs in a variety of formats from a
single source.  The output formats supported include PostScript, HTML, POD,
plain text, man pages, LaTeX, SGML, Windows help, MIF and RTF.  If the idea of
specifying documents in a logical manner via a simple markup language sounds
appealing, SDF may be useful to you.

SDF documents are simple to create and maintain, minimising the time spent on
documentation.  In particular, SDF directly supports the creation and
maintenance of large, on-line documentation systems (including intranets) via
centralised hypertext management and rule-based hypertext generation.

SDF is useful for?
==================
As well as normal documents, SDF is useful for:

o user manuals (paper-based and online)
o online document catalogs
o Perl module documentation
o Delphi component documentation
o source code listings (pretty printing most languages).

SDF is also good for literate programming, i.e. documentation can be embedded
in the comments of most programming languages and can be selectively
extracted.  The embedded documentation can be in any markup language you like,
although there are advantages to using SDF's markup language.

Requirements
============
SDF has been completely developed in Perl, a popular and highly portable
scripting language.  Perl 5.004 or later is recommended, although SDF may run
on earlier versions of Perl 5.

To generate PostScript, SDF requires one of the following:

o the freely available pod2ps program
o the freely available SGML-Tools and LaTeX packages
o FrameMaker 5.x or later
o another word processor which can import RTF.

Earlier versions of FrameMaker will generally work, but I don't explicitly
support them.

To generate Windows help, a help compiler (e.g. hcp.exe) is required.
