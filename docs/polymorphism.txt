Type polymorphism
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

"In computer science, polymorphism means allowing a single definition 
to be used with different types of data (specifically, different classes 
of objects). For instance, a polymorphic function definition can replace 
several type-specific ones, and a single polymorphic operator can act 
in expressions of various types. Many programming languages and paradigms 
implement some forms of polymorphism; for a popular example, see 
polymorphism in object-oriented programming."

"In more precise terms, polymorphism (object-oriented programming theory) 
is the ability of objects belonging to different types to respond to 
method calls of methods of the same name, each one according to an 
appropriate type-specific behaviour. The programmer (and the program) 
does not have to know the exact type of the object in advance, so this 
behavior can be implemented at run time (this is called late binding or 
dynamic binding)."

Object (computer science)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
"In the programming paradigm, object-oriented programming, an 
object is an individual unit of run-time data storage that is 
used as the basic building block of programs. These objects act 
on each other, as opposed to a traditional view in which a program 
may be seen as a collection of functions, or simply as a list of 
instructions to the computer. Each object is capable of receiving 
messages, processing data, and sending messages to other objects. 
Each object can be viewed as an independent little machine or actor 
with a distinct role or responsibility."
