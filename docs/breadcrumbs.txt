Information learned while working on AMI MOA Inspection Request 
project July 2007.

The COPortal in the administrative interface uses a cookie trail 
toolbar to display location and provide easy navigation.

=============================
The breadcrumb trail is implement in the getlayer4() function in 
menus.cfc. It is displayed dynamically as needed on every page 
at the bottom of the header.  Implementation required the use of
the L4 URL parameter the discipline editor, mainTypes.cfm and 
viewType.cfm were conflicting and using L4. Modified to use 
"subtype" URL parameter which getlayer4() uses to set the 
breadcrumb trail dynamically. A bit tricky but works well.

=============================
Decided that use of javascript for the cookie trail is overly complicated. 
Going to hard-code a breadcrumb trail in the administration interface.
